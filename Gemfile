# This file 'Gemfile' is used by the 'Bundler' gem to manage the gems that are needed
# for our Rails projects. We specify all the gems we need in here with the
# proper version and Bundler will automatically 'require' those gems for us.
# Bundler will auto-generate and will update a file called 'Gemfile.lock' which
# will specify the exam version of every gem that is being used. As you note below
# some Gems don't specify exact versions, however, when you run 'bundle install'
# bundler will lock the version to the latest current version installed on your
# system or it will install the latest from rubygems.org
